# Big-Data-Analytics-and-Applications-Project
<b>Big Data Analytics and Applications Project work</b>

This project has been implemented as part of the course 'Big Data Analytics and Applications'. Developed the heart disease prediction models using machine learning and deep learning algorithms. I have taken 'Heart Disease Data set' and 'Statlog (heart) Data set' from UCI machine learning repository. Implemented the machine learning and deep learning algorithms on these datasets and observed the results.

<b>Tools and Technologies:</b> Python, .
