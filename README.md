# Big-Data-Analytics-and-Applications-Project
<b>Big Data Analytics and Applications Project work</b>

This project has been implemented as part of the course 'Big Data Analytics and Applications'. Developed the heart disease prediction models using machine learning and deep learning algorithms. I have taken 'Heart Disease Data set' and 'Statlog (heart) Data set' from UCI machine learning repository and implemented the machine learning and deep learning algorithms on these datasets. Developed a basic web interface that accepts the inputs from the user and predicts the possibility of heart disease for the given input parameters.

<b>Tools and Technologies:</b> Python, Tensorflow, Flask, html, css, Pycharm, Intellij.
